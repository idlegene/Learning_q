    "All built-in q operators are functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between q’s functions and the ones we mortals can write are: \n",
    "* The built-ins are written and optimized in one of the underlying languages k or C. \n",
    "* All q functions can be used with infix notation—i.e., as operators—whereas ours must be used in prefix form. \n",
    "* Functions in q correspond to “lambda expressions” or “anonymous functions” in other languages. This means that a function is a first class value just like a long or float value—i.e., it acquires a name only once it is assigned to a variable. \n",
    "* Conceptually, a q function is a sequence of steps that produces an output result from an input value. Since q is not purely functional, these rules can interact with the world by reaching outside the context of the function. Such actions are called side effects and should be carefully controlled. \n",
    "* Function definition is delimited by matching curly braces ‘{‘ and ‘}’. Immediately after the opening brace, the formal parameters are names enclosed in square brackets ‘[‘ and ‘]’ and separated by semi- colons. These parameters presumably appear in the body of the function, which follows the formal parameters and is a succession of expressions sequenced by semi-colons. "
