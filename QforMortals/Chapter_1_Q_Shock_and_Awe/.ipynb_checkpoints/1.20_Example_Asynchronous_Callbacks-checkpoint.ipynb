    "The IPC mechanism of q does not have callbacks built in but it is powerful enough that we can create callbacks ourselves. We assume that you have started separate client and server q sessions and have opened the connection from the client to the server, as in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heretofore, calls to the server were synchronous, meaning that at the point of the remote call, the client blocks until the requested work on the server completes and the result is returned. It is also possible to make the remote call asynchronous. In this case, the client does not block: the application of the open handle returns immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate this, we have to come clean about what is really in the open handle h. See for yourself by displaying the h from an open connection."
